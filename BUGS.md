# Bugs

Known bugs, recorded by any role and fixed by the bugfix role.
Each bug: symptom, how to reproduce, suspected cause if known. Move fixed bugs to Fixed, with the
required `**Validation gap:** <tag> — <one sentence>` line recording what made the bug hard to
confirm (tag one of: none, no-repro, no-fake, real-run-needed, no-observability, slow-check,
unclear-invariant).

Bugs no role can fix under the project's rules are refused with a dated
`**Refused <date> by <role>: <one-line reason>**` note under the entry's heading; they stay in
`## Open` only while the user has not accepted the refusal. Once accepted, move the entry to
`## Won't fix` — positioned after `## Open` so triage reads only fixable entries first — with a
dated `**Won't fix <date> by the <role> role — user accepted the refusal**` line that records the
limitation the theme now carries and what a fix would have required. A refusal whose reason is
"the fix is a redesign, not a repair" does not end there by default: route the redesign to a
PLANS.md plan and let the user decide whether to fund it before moving the bug. (Directed by the
user 2026-11-01; recorded by the director role.)

### The inactive-dialog render gate's pixel pins can fail under a full parallel `make check` (found by the plan role 2026-11-13)

In one full `make check` run of 2026-11-13 (worktree one PLANS.md edit away
from main, no test or theme file touched),
`tests/test_render_surface.py::TestInactiveDialogRender` failed five pins:
`test_left_window_client_edge_is_the_recoloured_inner_rectangle`,
`test_left_window_field_is_the_flat_buttonless_bar`,
`test_left_window_outline_is_the_inactive_outline`,
`test_right_window_keeps_its_active_frame` and
`test_title_ink_is_the_inactive_text_colour`. The client-edge ring read
`#000000` where the pin expects `INACTIVE_OUTLINE`
(`#555555`, `tests/support/platinum_palette.py:42`) — the left window's
outline, field and title ink all read in the active family instead of the
inactive one.

Reproduce: run the full `make check` on the shared host. The module is not
red in isolation: `make check CHECK_TESTS='test_render_dialog_gates'`
immediately after the failing run passed all 92 of its tests, so no shipped
art, palette or test expectation is wrong on its own.

Suspected cause: the two-window `--inactive-dialog` capture races the
window manager's focus state under the parallel suite's load — the capture
appears to have caught the left window while KWin treated it as active (or
while the capture interleaved with another module's render session), so
every inactive pin met the active decoration instead. Not a SIGKILL case;
the ordinary-failure guarantee stands. A fix belongs to the capture
(settling the windows' focus state before reading pixels), not to the pins.

## Won't fix

### A killed GTK selection commit can leave settings files at different transaction versions (found by the robustness role 2026-11-01)

**Won't fix 2026-11-02 by the director role — user accepted the refusal**

Covered by the project-wide SIGKILL decision in PRINCIPLES.md (directed by the user
2026-11-02). Partial publication and leftover backups after SIGKILL are accepted limitations;
roles should use that standing decision when triaging equivalent reports.

`tools/gtk_staging.py::commit` publishes the GTK 3 settings, GTK 4 settings and GTK 4 user CSS
with separate replacements. Its rollback runs only when Python catches an exception; if the
process receives `SIGKILL` after one replacement, later files retain their old contents while
the first file contains the new selection, and its hidden hard-link backup remains. The GTK
selection is then partly applied despite the caller never completing.

Reproduce by staging different contents for two existing settings files, running `commit`, and
delivering `SIGKILL` after the first `os.replace` returns but before the second begins. The first
target contains new bytes, the second retains old bytes, and a `.backup` sibling remains. Recovery
would require a durable transaction record or another crash-consistent publication design;
in-process exception rollback cannot run after `SIGKILL`, and automatic recovery could overwrite
user edits made after the interrupted commit.
