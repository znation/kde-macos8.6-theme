### `make uninstall`'s color-scheme warning misses an indented `[General]` section header (found by the bugfix role 2026-10-19; fixed 2026-10-19 by the bugfix role)

**Symptom:** when `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/kdeglobals` opens its `[General]` section with a line
that has leading whitespace, `make uninstall` does not warn about a still-selected scheme.
KDE trims each line before parsing it, so the indented header still opens `[General]` and its
`ColorScheme` key is the live selection; the diagnostic claims to read kdeglobals "the way
KDE reads it", so the missing warning is a real, if low-severity, gap.

**Reproduction:**
`tests/test_colorscheme_install.py::TestInstall.test_make_uninstall_warns_for_an_indented_general_section`
writes `"  [General]\nColorScheme=MacOS8\n"` as kdeglobals and runs `make uninstall`; before
the fix it emitted no warning.

**Cause:** the uninstall recipe's `awk` recognised a section header only at the start of the
line (`/^\[/`), so an indented `[General]` was never seen as the current section and its
`ColorScheme` key was skipped.

**Fix:** the `awk` now matches and strips leading whitespace before the `[` (`/^[[:space:]]*\[/`),
matching KDE's trim-before-parse behaviour.

**Validation gap:** unclear-invariant — no test or doc stated that KDE's config reader trims a
line before matching a section header, so that invariant had to be established before the
parser could be pinned to it.
