# Plans

Planned features, written by the plan loop and implemented by the feature loop.
Each plan: goal, approach, files touched, acceptance criteria. Move finished plans to Done.

## Planned

**Scope drift (2026-10-08, steward; rewritten 2026-10-17, steward; shipped-artifact facts
updated 2026-10-21 by the clean role; plan status re-trimmed 2026-10-22 by the steward role;
font facts re-trimmed 2026-10-22 by the steward role; landed-plan facts re-trimmed 2026-10-23
by the clean role; validation scope clarified 2026-10-25 by the steward role; Firefox artifact
and content-surface status updated 2026-10-26 by the steward role; install-firefox
file list corrected 2026-10-27 by the steward role; shipped-SVG count updated
2026-10-27 by the feature role; Firefox content scope refreshed
2026-10-29 by the steward role):** The
initial prompt asks for
"the UI of MacOS 8.6, getting as close as possible to pixel-perfect theming." Shipped so far
(directories under `theme/`): the `MacOS8` color scheme; the `org.macos8.desktop` global theme
(startup splash, desktop layout, defaults); the desktop theme (thirty-one widget SVGs under
`widgets/`, including the `widgets/margins-highlight.svg` panel edit-mode margin highlight and the
`widgets/containment-controls.svg` panel resize and slider handles, plus
`dialogs/background.svg`); the Aurorae window decoration (frame, close, zoom and
collapse boxes); the desktop wallpaper package; the `org.macos8.desktop` icon theme (our own
32x32 Platinum-style art for the desktop's hard-disk, folder, document,
Trash and full-Trash icons, plus the menu bar's kicker logo `start-here-kde-symbolic` and the
`go-next-symbolic` submenu arrow, our own marks rather than Apple's;
the 2026-10-29 user decision supersedes its final-art status and queues placeholder tracking
below); the `org.macos8.desktop` Kvantum widget
style (Platinum palette and core-control art); the
`org.macos8.desktop` Lato font package (Lato Regular and Bold, the Debian copyright file
carrying the upstream SIL OFL 1.1 body, and the provenance record; installed by `make install`,
and the global theme selects its `Lato` family for the general, menu, toolbar, smallest-readable
and window-title fonts, while monospaced text keeps the user's fixed font); the GTK 3 and GTK 4
Platinum stylesheets under `theme/gtk/` (installed by the opt-in `install-gtk` target and
selected by `apply-gtk`; `make install` copies no GTK files); the standalone Firefox Platinum
sheets under `theme/firefox/` (its `userChrome.css` and `userContent.css` copied, and its
profile preference written, only by the opt-in `install-firefox` target); and the render and
fidelity tooling.
The live reference-comparison gate in `tests/test_render_surface.py` checks Aurorae window-chrome
regions when its render prerequisites are available (README.md, "Fidelity checking").
Firefox's `tests/test_firefox_theme_*.py` and `tests/test_firefox_content_*.py` modules
check stylesheet declarations and selector behavior;
those checks do not establish rendered Firefox pixels. Keep this distinction when assessing
progress toward pixel-perfect application chrome. README.md describes the reference set as the
source of truth for "menu bar, window chrome, widget metrics, icons and colour palette". The
prompt's surfaces and their status are each tracked here (updated 2026-10-21 by the
steward role): a **Qt widget style** for KDE applications (the desktop theme styles only
Plasma shell widgets, so a KDE app's own buttons, menus and scroll bars would keep the Breeze look) is served
by the global theme's selection of our Kvantum theme: the user answered
2026-10-18 that a pixel-matched Platinum style should ship as a Kvantum theme (a new
dependency) — shipped as the four-part "Mac OS 8.6 Kvantum widget style" series (each part
waited on the one before); a **cursor theme** was out of scope on 2026-10-17 because no reference
screenshot shows a cursor, so no pixel ground truth exists to match; on 2026-10-23 the plan role
queued it anyway as the theme's own Platinum-style pointer set (black-face, white-outline arrow,
text I-beam, pointing hand, busy hourglass, move cross, horizontal and vertical resize arrows,
NW-SE and NE-SW diagonal resize arrows, crosshair, circle-slash, drag-and-drop copy plus,
open and closed hands, the help question-mark arrow, the progress arrow with a small hourglass,
a pencil, the `zoom-in`/`zoom-out` magnifiers, and the drag-and-drop/forbidden aliases, not
traced from Apple's artwork), it
has landed inside the icon theme package with its provenance exception recorded in
`docs/invariants.md`, and `make apply-cursor`/`make remove-cursor` link it into the Xcursor path
and select it; Xcursor roles the theme does not name still come from the fallback cursor
theme; **system sounds** are out
of scope (not a visual surface, so the reference set cannot ground them); and a **lock screen** is
out of scope unless a broader login/lock-screen plan is taken up (QUESTIONS.md, answered
2026-10-21). The
shipped work should not be treated as the whole of the prompt.

Two answers on 2026-10-19 widen the scope again, and both are being implemented in series.
**GTK applications and Firefox** are in scope (QUESTIONS.md, answered 2026-10-19) as a
four-part series: parts 1/4 (GTK 3 Platinum theme) and 2/4 (GTK 4/libadwaita stylesheet) have
landed, and part 3/4 has landed as three entries — the opt-in install (parts 1/3 and 2/3) and
the selection (part 3/3) — while part 4/4 is split into two runs: part 1/2 (the
Firefox `userChrome.css` stylesheet) has landed and part 2/2 (the profile install plus the
preference) has landed. **The UI font** is to be vendored
(QUESTIONS.md, answered 2026-10-19) as a three-part series: part 1/3 vendors Lato as the
Charcoal-style body face and has landed (installed and selected by the global theme); part 2/3
(a Chicago-style menu face, whose redistribution licence is still unresolved) is not planned
yet; and part 3/3 (selecting the installed family in KDE/Plasma/Qt) has landed for the Lato
body face only, because Lato is the only family the package installs. KDE, Plasma and Qt
applications now use Lato for the general, menu, toolbar, smallest-readable and window-title
fonts, and monospaced text keeps the user's fixed font; GTK and Firefox
applications keep their own chrome unless the opt-in GTK targets or the Firefox userChrome
install are used (the GTK entries have landed, and Firefox chrome is part 1/2, which has
landed, while its profile install is part 2/2, which has landed). Firefox work since that
series landed as single-surface chrome plans (the downloads-panel and all-tabs rows, the
sidebar frame, the menu-bar title box, the tab faces and the app-menu rows). The
`userContent.css` sheet now styles surfaces within six internal pages:
about:downloads, about:config, about:preferences, about:support, about:networking
and about:telemetry. These include preferences navigation and controls, support
tables and buttons, and telemetry navigation, tables and histograms; this is
surface coverage, not a claim of complete page theming. The opt-in profile install
copies this sheet alongside `userChrome.css`. This content work extends the
2026-10-19 "style Firefox" answer rather than the brief's KDE/Plasma desktop UI, so it is
recorded here to keep the scope deliberate.

_None yet._

### Platinum GTK 4 scrollbars: preserve the fine-tune thumb face (planned 2026-10-29 by the plan role; independent of the queued thumb transition plan)

**Goal.** Keep the fine-tune scrollbar thumb on the opaque Platinum face through the supported `make apply-gtk` GTK 4 user stylesheet import, instead of the stock accent tint.

**Approach and files.** In `theme/gtk/org.macos8.desktop/gtk-4.0/gtk.css`, add a grouped rule for `scrollbar > range.fine-tune > trough > slider` and its `:hover` and `:active` variants, declaring only `background-color: #DDDDDD`. Add a dated adaptation comment: no reference screenshot shows GTK scrollbar fine-tune mode; reuse the existing reference-grounded base thumb face. In `tests/test_gtk4_theme.py`, add `TestGtk4Theme.test_scrollbar_fine_tune_thumb_face` using `assert_rule` for each selector and comparing its background color with the base thumb rule and `FACE`. Under `## gtk` in `docs/invariants.md`, record the guarantee and test, naming the stock grouped selectors' `color-mix(in srgb, var(--accent-color) 60%, transparent)` background from `/org/gnome/Adwaita/styles/base.css` in `/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libadwaita-1.so.0`, inspected 2026-10-29. Keep library attribution outside CSS for `test_stands_alone`.

**Acceptance criteria.** The fine-tune base, hover and active selectors explicitly declare the base thumb's opaque face for either orientation; removing a selector or restoring the accent blend fails the new test. Existing `test_scrollbar`, disabled-opacity and `TestScrollbarBreadthReference` coverage passes. The invariant names the missing reference surface and reused face source, and states that declaration coverage does not establish rendered pixels. Limit implementation to these three files and fine-tune background color; ordinary hover/active colors, overlay geometry and transitions are separate work. This plan can merge independently of the queued thumb transition plan. `make check` passes.

### Platinum GTK 4 scrollbar troughs: make state transitions immediate (planned 2026-10-29 by the plan role; independent of the queued fine-tune thumb face plan)

**Goal.** Apply GTK 4 scrollbar trough state changes immediately through the supported `make apply-gtk` user stylesheet import, following the existing thumb transition policy.

**Approach and files.** Add `transition: none` to the existing `scrollbar > range > trough` rule in `theme/gtk/org.macos8.desktop/gtk-4.0/gtk.css`. Add a dated adaptation comment naming the missing GTK scrollbar-trough motion reference and reusing the immediate thumb-state policy rather than claiming a measured duration. In `tests/test_gtk4_theme.py`, add `TestGtk4Theme.test_scrollbar_trough_transition` using `assert_rule` to pin that selector's transition to `none`. Under `## gtk` in `docs/invariants.md`, record the guarantee and test, citing the stock `scrollbar > range > trough { margin: 9px; transition: all 200ms linear; border-radius: 99px; }` rule from `/org/gnome/Adwaita/styles/base.css` in `/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libadwaita-1.so.0`, inspected 2026-10-29. Keep library provenance outside CSS for `test_stands_alone`.

**Acceptance criteria.** Removing the declaration or restoring the stock transition fails the new test. Existing `test_scrollbar`, `test_scrollbar_thumb_transition` and `TestScrollbarBreadthReference` coverage passes. The invariant names the missing reference surface and policy source, and states that declaration coverage does not establish rendered motion. Limit implementation to these three files and trough transition behavior; overlay geometry and interaction colors are separate work. This plan can merge independently of the queued fine-tune thumb face plan. `make check` passes.
